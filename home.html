    <h1>Fun With Strainers</h1>

    <div class='row mid'> 
      <div class='column mid'>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        What happens when we show people an unusual kitchen tool? <br><br>I set out to find out. In my apartment,
        we have a distinct kind of strainer - something most people have never seen before. <br><br> I asked three friends
        to use the strainer. I documented their interactions and asked them questions about their experiences.
        Based on their responses, I then created two personas that represent different users of the strainer. Finally, I designed a storyboard 
        for one of the personas.

        <h2> Design </h2>
        The hand-held strainer is a mostly flat, semi-circle of plastic. It is punctured with small holes 
        to facilitate straining and wide handles to comfortably hold the strainer. The bottom of the 
        surface contains small pegs to help anchor the strainer against the pot. <br><br>To use it, you place
        the strainer on top of the pot and turn the pot over while keeping the strainer pressed to the rim.

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <div>
    To begin my investigation, I watched three friends attempt to strain a pot of pasta. I chose these
    three friends because they span the spectrum of general kitchen experience and whether they had seen the strainer
    before.
  </div>

    <div class=row>
      <div class=column>
        <h3>Observee 1: Max, multi-time user</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Went directly to the sink before anchoring the strainer in place
            </li>
            <li>
              Swifly strained the pot, achieving a near 180-degree rotation of the pot
            </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class=column>
        <h3>Observee 2: Michael, first-time user</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spent ~10 seconds inspecting the strainer, trying to decipher which side was the top
            </li>
            <li>
              Originally misidentified the top and bottom, but corrected his mistake when he was about to begin straining
            </li>
            <li>
              Some of the contents of the pot spilled into the sink while straining
            </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class=column>
        <h3>Observee 3: Jake, first-time user</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Made ~3 attempts to anchor the strainer to the pot
            </li>
            <li>
              On each attempt, he wiggled the strainer to check how loose it was
            </li>
            <li>
            Placed his non-pot hand in the center of the strainer (near the holes) rather than on the grips
            </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    
    <h2>Interview Questions</h2>

    <div>
    Prior to collecting observations from my three friends, I drafted a series of questions to ask them.
    I asked the questions after I collected the observations. The goal of these questions was to gain a 
    deeper understanding of their interaction - expectations, challenges, background, etc. - with the strainer.
  </div>

  <div>
    <ol>

      <li>
        <h3>What do you think the interface is used for? (asked after being shown the interface) </h3>

        Max quickly identified that the interface was a strainer. <br><br> 
        Michael and Jake both guessed that
        it was a strainer, but only after some consideration and inspection of the interface.
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3>On a scale from 1-10 (10 being the highest), how confident were you that you knew how to properly use it?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Max: 10
          </li>
          <li>
            Michael: 5
          </li>
          <li>
            Jake: 10
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3>Do you typically use other interfaces for straining food? If so, can you compare this interface to your usual strainer?</h3>

        All three responded that they typically uses other interfaces for straining:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Nested Perferated Pot (Max): Only lift the interior pot and the water drains to the outer pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Colander (Jake, Michael): Dump the contents of the pot into the collander. Must ensure that
            the collander can fit the contents of the pot. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3> What are a few words that describe how you felt when you were using it?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Max: at ease and comfortable
          </li>
          <li>
            Michael: concerned and anxious
          </li>
          <li>
            Jake: on edge and uncomfortable
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3> Can you elaborate on why you chose those words?</h3>

        Max said that the strainer was easy to use and intuitive. For him, it felt natural to use. <br><br>
        Michael shared a different perspective. He said that he was nervous about being burned and also spilling
        the food into the sink. Additionally, Michael noted that he didn't think the strainer was
        the right size for the pot and wasn't sure if he was using it correctly. <br><br>
        
        Jake said that he felt uncomfortable for two reasons. First, because of the potential burn risk.
        Second, because his body got covered in the steam that emerged from the pot while straining.
      </li>


      <li>
        <h3>On a scale from 1-10 (10 being the highest), how comfortable are you in the kitchen?</h3>
         
        <ul>
          <li>
            Max: 10
          </li>
          <li>
            Michael: 4
          </li>
          <li>
            Jake: 7
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ol>

  </div>

    <br>


    <h2>Personas</h2>

    <div>
        These responses led me to create two personas: "Snackpass Sam" and "Chef Cece." These personas differ
        in a few keys ways, most importantly with their experience in the kitchen. I designed the 
        empathy maps below to dive deeper into the personalities and motivations of the personas.

      </div>

    <div class=row>
      <div class='column mid'>
        <img src= "sam.png" width="660px">
      </div>
      <div class='column mid'>
        <img src= "cece.png" width="660px">
      </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
  
    <div>
      I decided to base my storyboard on "Snapckpass Sam." After all, I think I'm far more like him
      than "Chef Cece." 
    </div>

    <div class=row>
      <img src= "s1.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s2.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s3.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s4.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s5.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s6.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s7.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s8.png" width="400px">
      <img src= "s9.png" width="400px">
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div>
      Hand-held strainers can be great, but they clearly aren't for everyone!
